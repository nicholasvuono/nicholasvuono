## Hello 👋🏻

I enjoy building things and making sure they don't break! </br>

A Senior Engineer @ [Accumulus Synergy](https://www.accumulus.org/) </br>
Ex-Lead Engineer @ [Unqork](https://unqork.com/)</br></br>


🏎️ **Daily Drivers**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Playwright, k6, Jest, Docker, etc. </br></br>
🌱 **Growing Skills**: Golang & AstroJS </br></br>
🔨 **Currently Building**: Open source testing frameworks & a tech blog </br></br>
⚡️ **Fun fact**: Teammates have described me as calm, consistent, hardworking and easy to work with. So, I'm coining the term _**Equable Engineer**_ as my own </br></br>
